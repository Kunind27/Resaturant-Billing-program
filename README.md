<h1>**Restaurant Billing Program**</h1>

This is a Restaurant billing prototype with basic **CRUD** features which I developed for my **ICSE 2017 Computer Applications** project.
Its currently run in manager mode with provisions for adding ne dishes, deleting dishes, changing cost of the dishes, placing a customer's order and viewing the complete itemised bill.
Also care has been taken to handle exceptions during runtime so they don't terminate the program using Try-Catch
